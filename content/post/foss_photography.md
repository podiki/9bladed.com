Photography can easily become a very expensive hobby, from the cost of camera bodies, lenses, accessories, and software.

[Free (as in free to do whatever you wish with it)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and [open source (as in you can view the underlying computer code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software.

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) means that a user has the freedom to use and do with the software whatever they like.

The website [Pixl.us](https://pixls.us/) has a very nice [list of software](https://pixls.us/software/) and active [discussion forum](https://discuss.pixls.us/).

I started using Darktable at the end of last year as a replacement for Adobe's Lightroom. All of the [photos](https://flic.kr/s/aHskKLsCay) in my [Paris photo essay](file:///photo-essay/paris) were edited with Darkroom.
