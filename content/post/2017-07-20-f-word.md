An essay I have written has just been published!

<!--more-->

You can read it here: ["The Worst F-Word"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-worst-f-word/) at *The Chronicle of Higher Education*.

The comments I had received from my friends on an earlier draft, and from many others now that it is public, have been overwhelmingly supportive and understanding. As I write in the essay, one of the biggest hurdles since being out of the academic world has been worrying about what other people think and how they view you now. It felt good to write about this and bare myself, especially as one that normally shies away from such publicity.

It has been truly wonderful to see the response, and I am sure I will have more to say after this sinks in, as well as much more to write. For now, I wanted to thank Aoife for impressing upon me some of key points in the essay, Suzan for pointing me to *The Chronicle*, and *The Chronicle* for giving me the opportunity to share this with the world. Thanks.

Again, you can find the essay here: [The Worst F-Word](http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Worst-F-Word/240669?cid=wcontentgrid_hp_2)
