Hi, my name is John and I'm a recovering theoretical physicist. Until recently I worked as a postdoctoral researcher, doing physics around the world. This is my personal website for sharing various thoughts in blog posts, and more structured writing in the form of essays and photo essays. Thanks for stopping by!
