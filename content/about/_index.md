Hi, my name is John and I'm a recovering physicist. This website will be home to my various pondering (the blog), more structured writing (essays), and everything in between. At the start my main goals are to explore my transition from the academic life of a theoretical physicist (to what, remains unknown), think and write about what photography means to me, and perhaps some creative writing. I'd also like to try to give back, in some way, to all the invaluable technical information I've used on the internet for so long.

### Links

This is mainly where I post more "serious" photographs, taken with my trusty Nikon D7000

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/9bladed)
Late to the game of Instagram, but I've found it a great place to share photos from my smartphone, which I don't post to Flickr.

Often not completely up to date with my Flickr, but a great place to explore photos as well.

[Github](https://www.github.com/podiki)
Not too much on there right now (some smaller projects and config files), though I have many programming projects I hope to work on in the near future.

[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/9bladed)
Sometimes I tweet.
