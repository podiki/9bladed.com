![That's me!](/images/avatar.jpg)

Hi, my name is John and I'm a recovering theoretical physicist. In the recent past I worked as a postdoctoral researcher, doing physics around the world. Currently I'm a Lecturer in Critical Writing at UPenn. This is my personal website for sharing various thoughts in blog posts, and more structured writing in the form of essays and photo essays. Thanks for stopping by!

### Want to hire me?

While my day job is teaching, I am also a freelance writer, photographer, and data science consultant. For longer form writing samples, see [essays](/essay) on this website or published work linked below, and for shorter see [blog posts](/post). Technical writing in the form of physics research papers can be found on my [CV](/files/cv.pdf). For photography, this website is home to my recent foray into [photo essays](/photo-essay), or see my [portfolios on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/collections/72157645088907014/) and other links below.
