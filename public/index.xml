      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974202635/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Montparnasse&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/431/31974202635_31ffcc37b7_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Something I&amp;rsquo;ve long been thinking about doing are photo stories or essays, combining a set of photos into a larger, more cohesive, work. This is my first attempt after recently taking a trip to Paris, one of my favorite cities. Comments welcome! Click on a photo to view it full size on Flickr, until I add some fancy gallery.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the train pulled into Gare du Nord and I took my first walk in Paris after many years, I was once again struck by the magic that I feel in only a few cities I have ever visited. On that first night, and for every day on this trip, I thought about how to put into words and photographs what exactly is that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;magic&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I did not find it where I thought I would, and instead found myself experiencing yet another side of Paris&amp;#x2026;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think of Paris it is not just one aspect of the city that jumps out at me, but the plethora of offerings: history, art, cafes, shops, and on and on. Paris plays perfectly into my preferred way of exploring urban life, wandering from sight to sight, camera in hand stumbling onto something unexpected around every corner. On this visit though, I got a taste of typical winter weather in Paris: it was chilly, rainy, and all together unpleasant to be out and about for long, especially given my lack of preparation. I would not find the Paris of summers before, and my quest to find some way to capture the magic of Paris would have to turn in new directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a freedom that comes from repeat visits to a place. Once you have seen what you feel obligated to see (&amp;ldquo;How could you go to Paris and not see the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomph, etc. etc.?&amp;rdquo;) you can wander without the pressures of what you &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; do, without the worry of missing out on the most famous sights, even if there is always more on that list. In a place like Paris it is impossible to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bump into something famous wherever you turn, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist seeing a few again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974202725/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; On My Perch Of Bones&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/320/31974202725_53498b20e2_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High on my list was to visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris&#34;&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; again, and one day hopefully take a walk in the unsanctioned maze of tunnels that lie beneath the entire city. In the officially open part of the catacombs are piles and piles of bones from long dead residents of the city that have been moved as cemeteries filled up and the city expanded. Perhaps what is most remarkable is how the bones are all neatly piled, sometimes with skulls arranged in a cross or some other shape, going on and on in long corridors beneath the bustling city above. After the long line and the crowded initial parts, if you walk slowly, you soon find yourself alone with the anonymous remains of countless former Parisians. It is quiet and otherworldly. A unique experience, as eerie, exciting, and just plain different as the first time I was there years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974200025/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Our Lady at Night&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c2.staticflickr.com/1/744/31974200025_bd94da064d_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the main attractions of Paris are even more beautiful at night, long after the crowds have gone, lit up to shine in the brisk evening air. Notre Dame is breathtaking every time I see it. Being able to leisurely stroll around it, seeing it from front and back, from right under its towering facade to across the Seine, warms the eyes and heart, if not the hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974202455/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Into the Clouds&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/741/31974202455_6607552d35_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the weather was not what I imagined, thinking back to sitting on the bright green grass in the sun beside the Eiffel Tower, it lent itself to yet another way to see Paris. The Eiffel Tower was still there, somewhere, hiding and blending into the fog and clouds, gray everywhere. The city took on another look, another feel, different from the typical postcard look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974202325/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Graffiti Boat&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/663/31974202325_15ff5be128_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last several years I have made a point of visiting graffiti or street art in the cities I travel to. Besides appreciating the message and aesthetics of the art itself (as the counter culture turns both more mainstream and yet still subversive), it is a wonderful way to explore a city, often taking me to parts I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise found myself in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974201555/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Sockets and Plugs&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/492/31974201555_65537b678b_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highlight of this trip was visiting an abandoned railway circling Paris, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemin_de_fer_de_Petite_Ceinture&#34;&gt;Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture&lt;/a&gt; (the &amp;ldquo;little belt railway&amp;rdquo;). It has not been in use for many decades and now the tracks in at least one section are home to wonderful street art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974202075/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Graffiti Tunnel&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/632/31974202075_8cfdb77e54_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking along the tracks, alone even as I was surrounded by occupied buildings on expensive real estate, felt special, like a secret hidden in plain sight in one of the biggest tourist cities in the world. The art mingled and battled with nature, while the tracks, long since unused, were a constant reminder of the function this place once had, of a different world entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974201835/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Camouflage&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/351/31974201835_0036202295_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974201345/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; One in Three&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c2.staticflickr.com/1/705/31974201345_889699105d_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearby is one of Paris&amp;rsquo;s famous cemeteries, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%25C3%25A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery&#34;&gt;Cimetière du Père Lachaise&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps most famous as the final resting place of Oscar Wilde, Jim Morrison, Frédéric Chopin, Honoré de Balzac, and Georges Bizet, among many others. I visited a couple of large cemeteries in Paris for the first time, filled with some familiar names and countless others I did not know. The tombstones range from simple to elaborate and ostentatious, some within the past few years, while others had years that were barely legible in their age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974201145/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Eternal Tears&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c2.staticflickr.com/1/675/31974201145_e2f1128e5f_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another terrific spot for street art is in Belleville, on Rue Denoyez. The quiet street (at least on a weekday afternoon) is absolutely covered in art over the walls, doors, and shutters of the stores and buildings on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974201035/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; We Can Be Heroes&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/496/31974201035_b117cb5f21_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974200735/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; L&amp;#x27;Epicerie&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/627/31974200735_bd9d3cb575_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belleville itself is a more working class neighborhood filled with artists and many different ethnic groups, and all the languages, stores, and restaurants that come with it. It may well be next up for the hot new neighborhood in Paris and the gentrification that comes with it, but for now it remains off the usual tourist lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974200325/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Drink &amp;amp; Read&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/759/31974200325_51db523710_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974200595/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Put &amp;#x27;em Up&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/482/31974200595_d30b22e164_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite time to wander a city to see it in its best light is as the sun goes down, from dusk into the night. There is something about the mixture of the last embers of the fading natural light with the awakening lamps and neon signs of human creation that always draws my eye. Paris, &amp;ldquo;The City of Light,&amp;rdquo; truly shines as day turns to night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31974199745/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Stairs on the Seine&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c2.staticflickr.com/1/260/31974199745_035fb2fa79_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not find what I expected to when I set out to try and understand what it is that makes Paris that special city to me, but instead found yet another side to the city. I will have to come back again (and again&amp;#x2026;) to chase those words and images that might somehow capture it, hopefully coming a little bit closer each time. And I think I will be lucky again, and find something new around the next corner to keep me coming back, the magic always there in some new and different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/31134187044/in/album-72157674627219114/&#34; title=&#34; Parisian Night&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34; https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/778/31134187044_7082d95a74_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Existential Crisis</title>
      <link>https://9bladed.com/essay/existential/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2016 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://9bladed.com/essay/existential/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 5 years as a gradstudent and 5 years as a postdoc (researcher) in physics, my academic career has come to an end. This was not on my terms; I had come up short of my dream to be a tenured faculty member at a research university. I sold off what little furniture I had, packed up my few belongings, drove 1,000 miles (which turned out to be the end for the car) from the South back to the Northeast, and finally hopped on a plane to Europe. My current plan, if you can call it that, is only for a few months, to revive some dormant passion projects, in the hope of finding my path forward for whatever is next&amp;#x2026;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every night as I fall asleep, and every morning when I wake up, I am hit with a recurrent barrage of upsetting thoughts and questions: a crisis. While there are many pressing issues that could be the cause, from not having a job or even a career path, to the always tumultuous world we live in, it is the &lt;em&gt;existential&lt;/em&gt; which bookends my days and nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have often pondered the meaning of my life and aspirations, this was usually in the context of being a physicist and doing research. In a broad sense I worked in a scientific field that aims to understand the fundamental nature of the universe, that attempts to reach and understand the truth of reality as deeply as we are capable of. The day to day of being a physicist, however, is far from thinking deeply about the universe and mathematics. Still, there was always this larger world that I fit into, that my work, however small and insignificant, fit into. It was, and still is, something I deeply believe in and value. Unfortunately, it is no longer my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the short term, at least, my world and daily life has turned to the many projects I had started and stopped, thought about, and previously left for another time. Beyond the usual everyday excuses, there was always this overriding excuse to put them off: the desire to be a good physicist. How could I justify dedicating any of my energy and passion to a side project when the road to a tenured faculty position is so very long and exceedingly difficult? These other projects I wish to pursue require the same type of ingredients as research. Ingredients like creativity, perseverance, and critical thinking do not come with an unlimited supply each day, so shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I spend what I have in pursuit of doing better physics? I am not one to completely sacrifice my many other interests, but these kinds of thoughts nagged at me, driving a little more doubt and difficulty in the way of trying to accomplish anything else. Physics did not consume me day and night, but there was the constant guilt and reminder of the price I may pay for putting my efforts elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no such excuses now. I can spend my time doing whatever I like, at least for the immediate future. That is the freedom I am buying thanks to my very modest financial means and network of kind friends. Though I have lost my place in the academic world I love so much, with it has gone the weight and pressures of all that it entails. Without that life anymore I am left without a goal and direction, but instead I am liberated to follow whatever path I choose. This freedom can be crushing in its enormity, and yet also a cage made of bars much stronger than &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have time now, maybe tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be true? For one thing, gone is the almost automatic feeling of knowing where your piece fits as part of the larger puzzle. Even if my own small contribution did not have a significant impact, it was part of a collective effort with a clear goal I believed in. This no longer holds me together; part of me is constantly seeking and questioning. What is the purpose of what I am doing? Will this accomplish anything? Is there any point to this? I feel suddenly very alone, existentially isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that a life in the sciences is not the only place I can find meaning, of course. And a job can just be a job&amp;#x2014;it does not have to be for some higher purpose in of itself. I would argue, though, that we all seek out some deeper connection and larger purpose through the groups we make part of our life, whether that is an occupation, hobby, religion, or something else. Sometimes it is not as direct of a link as &amp;ldquo;doing what you love,&amp;rdquo; but it is there, somewhere in our lives. I think this is one of the essential purposes of the larger entities we each subscribe to: it provides a backdrop, context, a greater purpose to all the &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; things we must do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the biggest of these communities and directions gone from my life I am left both free and lost. Now any project I want to undertake is under the lens of Purpose and Impact, of making something Worthwhile and Lasting. But there is the difficult path of innumerable small steps, starts and stops, failures, and all the hard work between here and There. Suddenly all I can see is the final destination and it is utterly overwhelming. Something great will not come from nothing, but that something has become a fixation. Paralyzed by the freedom to take any step in any direction, I stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it is a fortunate situation to be in, but how do I take advantage of this opportunity, rather than squander it? One of my biggest fears is to waste this chance, to let it become another &amp;ldquo;what if,&amp;rdquo; to let laziness and excuses win out and never actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything. There is a myriad of resources on how to tackle large projects, advice from the giants I want to emulate on how to keep going, to expect and thrive on the many failures that come first. Ultimately, though, my problem is indeed existential. If I choose to define myself by what I hope to accomplish then all of this doubt, uncertainty, fear &amp;#x2014; this burden &amp;#x2014; comes with the territory. It is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; decision though, one that I am so very lucky to be able to make. It is by &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; that I take this on with both the hubris that perhaps I can succeed and live up to my lofty ideals, and the fear that I probably will not. I will take all of that over the regret I will face if I do not even try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An existential crisis, hounding me every day, then. I must conquer my paralysis and use this crisis to find my way, to live and do now rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thanks to Brandon, Aoife, Richard, and Gulnaz for reading and commenting on an earlier draft of this essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relaunch</title>
      <link>https://9bladed.com/post/relaunch/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/9bladed/28861739920&#34; title=&#34;Majestic&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8395/28861739920_7945771ebe_o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Majestic&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again (I&amp;rsquo;ve lost track of how many times) I am rebranding and relaunching my website. I would love to give some assurances (mostly to myself) that it is for good and will continue posting regularly, but I think I finally know enough to not make such promises. I am hopeful, though, mostly because of my current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it briefly, since I plan on going into many details in later writings, my time as a theoretical physicist has come to a close. I am no longer working as a researcher in academia, and have decided to go out in the world and work on the many other things I am interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One goal of mine is to write more, and this website will be home to a collection of essays. As I alluded to above, this includes a series as a sort of &amp;ldquo;postmortem&amp;rdquo; on my time as a physicist. Another broad topic is photography. This is something I have interested in and snapping away at for many years, and at this point I find myself reflecting more on what it means to me and what I hope to accomplish. This is something I will be exploring, in both words and images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my plan right now. Without the distractions of a proper job there are no more excuses&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
