      <description>Hi there.
Yet again (I&amp;rsquo;ve lost track of how many times) I am rebranding and relaunching my website. I would love to give some assurances (mostly to myself) that it is for good and will continue posting regularly, but I think I finally know enough to not make such promises. I am hopeful, though, mostly because of my current situation.
To put it briefly, since I plan on going into many details in later writings, my time as a theoretical physicist has come to a close.</description>
